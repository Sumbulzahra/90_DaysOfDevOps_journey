# 🛠️ Task 4: Hands-On with Networking Commands

## 📋 Task Requirements
The objective of this task is to practice and document essential networking commands used for troubleshooting and verifying connectivity.

### Commands to Master:
1. ping: Check if a host is reachable.
2. traceroute / tracert: Trace the path packets take to a destination.
3. netstat: View active network connections and listening ports.
4. curl: Transfer data from or to a server (used for testing APIs/Websites).
5. dig / nslookup: Query DNS name servers for IP mapping.

## 💻 Networking Commands Cheat Sheet

### 1. Connectivity Check (ping)
Used to test if a remote server is "alive" and to check for latency.
* Example: ping google.com
* Usage: Determines if there is a basic connection between your machine and the target.

### 2. Path Tracking (traceroute)
Identifies every "hop" (router) your data passes through to reach a destination.
* Example: traceroute google.com (Linux/Mac) or tracert google.com (Windows)
* Usage: Great for finding exactly where a connection is being dropped in a network.

### 3. Network Statistics (netstat)
Displays all active network connections and which ports are currently "listening" on your machine.
* Example: netstat -tuln
* Usage: Essential for verifying if your web server or database is actually running on the expected port.

### 4. Web Requests (curl)
A powerful tool to interact with web servers directly from the terminal.
* Example: curl -I https://aws.amazon.com
* Usage: Used to check HTTP response headers (like 200 OK or 404 Not Found) without a browser.

### 5. DNS Lookup (dig)
Queries DNS servers to see which IP address a domain name points to.
* Example: dig google.com
* Usage: Used to verify if DNS records have propagated or if a domain is pointing to the correct Load Balancer.

## 💡 Troubleshooting Workflow
As a DevOps Engineer, I use these in sequence:
1. ping to see if the server is up.
2. telnet or nc to see if the specific port is open.
3. curl to see if the application is responding correctly.
4. dig if I suspect the domain name is pointing to the wrong IP.

> **Task Status:** Completed. I have tested these commands on my local machine and EC2 instance to build my troubleshooting toolkit. ✅
