# 📂 Task 2: Protocols and Ports for DevOps

Understanding protocols is the key to securing and connecting infrastructure.

### 🔑 Essential Protocols Cheat Sheet

* SSH (22): The gateway for remote server management.
* HTTP (80) & HTTPS (443): The foundation of web communication.
* DNS (53): The internet's phonebook.
* Database Ports: 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (Postgres), 6379 (Redis).

### 💡 DevOps Relevance
In a CI/CD pipeline, we often need to:

1. Open ports in a firewall (Security Groups) to allow application traffic.
2. Forward ports in Docker containers (e.g., -p 8080:80).
3. Debug connectivity using tools like telnet or nc (netcat).

> **Task Completed:** I have researched and documented the most common ports used in modern cloud environments.
