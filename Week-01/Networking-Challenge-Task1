# 🌐 Week 1: Networking Challenge - Task 1
## Mastering the OSI & TCP/IP Models

Welcome to the first task of my #90DaysOfDevOps journey! Today, I focused on the fundamental "plumbing" of the internet: understanding how data travels across a network using the OSI and TCP/IP models.

## 📖 Overview
In DevOps, networking knowledge is critical for troubleshooting connectivity issues, configuring cloud security groups, and managing microservices. 

### The Two Models:
1. OSI Model (Theoretical): A 7-layer framework used to standardize the functions of a computing system.
2. TCP/IP Model (Practical): A 4-layer model that represents the actual protocols used on the internet today.

## 🛠️ Mapping Layers to Real-World Scenarios

| OSI Layer | TCP/IP Layer | Purpose | Real-World Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 7. Application | Application | User Interface & Services | Accessing a website via HTTP/HTTPS |
| 6. Presentation | Application | Data Encryption & Formatting | SSL/TLS encrypting login credentials |
| 5. Session | Application | Connection Management | Maintaining a login session on a portal |
| 4. Transport | Transport | End-to-end communication | TCP ensuring data arrives without errors |
| 3. Network | Internet | Routing & IP Addressing | IP Addresses routing packets across VPCs |
| 2. Data Link | Network Access | MAC Addressing | Ethernet frames moving within a LAN |
| 1. Physical | Network Access | Physical Hardware | Fiber optic cables or Wi-Fi signals |

## 💡 Why This Matters for DevOps
Understanding these layers allows me to troubleshoot systematically:
* Application Issue? Check the HTTP status codes (4xx/5xx).
* Connectivity Issue? Check if the Port (Layer 4) is open in the Security Group.
* Routing Issue? Check the IP tables or Route Tables (Layer 3).

## 🚀 Next Steps
Now that the foundation is set, I will move on to Task 2: Protocols and Ports for DevOps, where I'll dive deeper into specific communication standards like SSH, DNS, and FTP.
