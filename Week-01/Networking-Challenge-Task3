# ☁️ Task 3: AWS EC2 and Security Groups

## 🎯 Objective
To launch a virtual server (EC2) and implement network security using AWS Security Groups. This task bridges the gap between networking theory and cloud infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Launching the Instance
* AMI: Amazon Linux 2023 (Free Tier eligible).
* Instance Type: t2.micro.
* Key Pair: Created and downloaded a .pem file for secure SSH access via terminal.

### 2. Configuring the Firewall (Security Groups)
I created a custom Security Group to act as a virtual firewall for the instance. The rules were configured as follows:

* SSH (Port 22): Allowed access only from my specific IP address for secure administration.
* HTTP (Port 80): Opened to 0.0.0.0/0 to allow public web traffic.
* HTTPS (Port 443): Opened to 0.0.0.0/0 for secure, encrypted web traffic.
* Outbound Rules: Left as default (Allow All) to allow the server to fetch updates.

### 3. Verification
* Successfully connected to the instance using the command: ssh -i "private-key.pem" ec2-user@public-ip
* Verified that only the specified ports were accessible, confirming the security group was functioning correctly.

## 🧠 Key Learning
Security Groups are stateful. This means if an inbound request is allowed on a specific port, the outbound response is automatically allowed, regardless of outbound rules. This is a critical concept for managing cloud traffic efficiently.

> **Task Status:** Completed. Instance is live, secured, and accessible. ✅
