# Task 1: User & Group Management 👤

## Objective
To establish a secure, multi-user environment by implementing proper user categorization, administrative privileges, and SSH hardening.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Group & User Creation
I created a dedicated group for the DevOps team and added a specific user to it to ensure organized permission management.
```bash
# Create the group
sudo groupadd devops_team

# Create the user and assign to the group
sudo useradd -m -g devops_team devops_user
